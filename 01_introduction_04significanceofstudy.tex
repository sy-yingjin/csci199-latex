\section{Significance of the Study}
This paper aims to contribute to the field of computational social science by analyzing the behavior of users and political candidates in online spaces during election periods, especially in the Philippine context where such a kind of study has yet to be pursued in-depth. The interaction of ABM and cross-lingual transformers like XLM-RoBERTa can computationally create a pipeline from analyzing a large-scale X dataset to simulating real-world interactions by: (a) scraping posts from X in bulk, (b) extracting the necessary sentiments from said posts about electoral candidates to define the necessary models for the simulation, (c) running and refining the simulation to accurately reflect past elections, and finally (d) extending the simulation by predicting future elections. The combined usage of ABM and LLM in the local context is significant for future researchers who plan to explore further the interaction between transformer models and agent-based modeling from the perspective of social events other than elections.
