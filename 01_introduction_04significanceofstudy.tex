\section{Significance of the Study}
This paper aims to contribute to the field of computational science by analyzing the behavior of users and political candidates in online spaces during election periods, especially in the Philippine context. The interaction of ABM and cross-lingual transformers like XLM-RoBERTa can computationally create a  “pipeline” from analyzing a large-scale X dataset to simulating real-world interactions: first by scraping posts from X in bulk; then extracting the necessary sentiments from said posts about electoral candidates to define the necessary models for the simulation; then running and refining the simulation to accurately reflect past elections; and then finally extending the simulation by predicting future elections. The combined usage of ABM and LLM in the local context is significant for future researchers who plan to explore further the interaction between transformer models and agent-based modeling from the perspective of social events other than elections.
