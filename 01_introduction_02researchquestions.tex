\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used for sentiment analysis on social media posts. Can these techniques, specifically the RoBERTa-model, be used to predict election outcomes?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is RoBERTa able to accurately capture the texts and sentiments shared by Philippine social media users from US social media users?
        \item Do the different themes, frequencies, and sentiments of keywords and phrases expressed by users on Facebook, X, (formerly Twitter), and TikTok indicate their support for the candidates?
        \item Can a developed visualization effectively illustrate social media presences throughout the four elections (Marcos Jr. vs. Robredo, Duterte vs. Roxas in the 2022 and 2016 Philippine elections respectively; and Trump vs. Harris, Trump vs. Biden in 2024 and 2020 US elections respectively), and whether or not these presences predicted their electoral results?
        \item Do the results from the RoBERTa model for the Philippines and United States have the same predictions and findings or do they contradict?
