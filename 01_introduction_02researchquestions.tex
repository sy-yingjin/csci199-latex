\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can Agent-Based Modeling effectively predict election results by way of simulating interactions between users on social media that are centered around electoral candidates?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The XLM-RoBERTA model can be used to perform sentiment analysis on multilingual Filipino and English posts. Can the sentiments classified by XLM-RoBERTA extract the necessary sentiments needed to define social media users as agents in a simulation?
        \item Can the parameterized model not only simulate the recent 2025 Philippine senatorial elections, but also predict future elections as well (i.e. 2028 Philippine presidential elections)?
        \item How can the accuracy of the Agent-Based model be determined in\\
        terms of predicting electoral wins?
