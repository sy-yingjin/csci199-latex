\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can Agent-Based Modelling effectively predict election results by way of simulating interactions between users on social media that are centered around electoral candidates? 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The XLM-RoBERTA model can be used to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts in Filipino and English. Can XLM-RoBERTA extract the necessary sentiments needed to define a social media user as an agent?
        \item By using Agent-Based Modelling on social media data on the 2019 Philippine senatorial elections and 2022 Philippine presidential elections, can this model simulate the recent 2025 Philippine senatorial elections and accurately determine the winners of that election?
        \item Can the Agent-Based Model not only capture an accurate simulation of previous presidential elections, but also predict future elections as well, e.g. 2028 Philippine presidential elections?
