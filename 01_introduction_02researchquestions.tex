\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can Agent-Based Modeling effectively predict election results by way of simulating interactions between users on social media that are centered around electoral candidates?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The XLM-RoBERTA model can be used to perform sentiment analysis on multilingual Filipino and English posts. Can the sentiments classified by XLM-RoBERTA extract the necessary sentiments needed to define social media users as agents in a simulation?
        \item Can the parameterized model not only simulate the recent 2025 Philippine senatorial elections, but also predict winning candidates if a Presidential election were to be held in the current year as of writing (2025)?
        \item Does the analysis produced by conducting an Agent-Based simulation of the elections reflect actual winning candidate statistics of Philippine elections?
    \end{enumerate}
