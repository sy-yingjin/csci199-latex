\section{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can Agent-Based Modeling effectively predict election results by way of simulating interactions between users on social media that are centered around electoral candidates? 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The XLM-RoBERTA model can be used to perform sentiment analysis on multilingual Filipino and English posts. Can the sentiments classified by XLM-RoBERTA extract the necessary sentiments needed to define social media users as agents in a simulation?
        \item Can the parameterized model simulate the recent 2025 Philippine senatorial elections and accurately determine the winners of that election?
        \item Can the Agent-Based Model not only capture an accurate simulation of previous presidential elections, but also predict future elections as well, i.e. 2028 Philippine presidential elections?
    \end{enumerate}
