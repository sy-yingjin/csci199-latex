\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyze different texts on social media platforms to draw insights on how different presidential candidates were perceived by social media users, and how these perceptions were shared online.
    \item Determine if these perceptions directly translated into electoral wins, or if other factors contributed to the outcome in the case that social media support did not indicate an electoral win
    \item Develop a dashboard providing a comprehensive overview of social media sentiments in relation to election results by comparing results drawn from sentiment analysis algorithms and actual elections results
