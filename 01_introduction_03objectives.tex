\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used for sentiment analysis on social media posts. For this paper, NLP and RoBERTa are being tested on its ability to predict election outcomes.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Capture the frequency of the sentiments and texts shared by Philippine social media users and US social media users.
        \item Determine the sentiments shared by users on X (formerly Twitter) towards the candidates and whether or not these sentiments indicate their support and a candidate's electoral win.
        \item Compare the conclusions of the first two objectives with one another to reaffirm the consistency and accuracy of the algorithmâ€™s output for both analyzed elections.
        \item Develop a dashboard providing a comprehensive overview of social media sentiments in relation to election results by comparing results\\drawn from sentiment analysis algorithms and actual election results.
