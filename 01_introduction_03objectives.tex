\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used for sentiment analysis on social media posts. For this paper, NLP and RoBERTa are being tested on its ability to predict election outcomes.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Determine the different texts on social media platforms to draw insights on how different presidential candidates were perceived by social media users.
        \item Analyze different texts on social media platforms to draw insights on how different presidential candidates were perceived by social media users, how often these perceptions are shared, and the general sentiment.
        \item Develop a dashboard providing a comprehensive overview of social media sentiments in relation to election results by comparing results\\drawn from sentiment analysis algorithms and actual elections results
        \item Compare the conclusions of the first two objectives with one another to reaffirm the consistency and accuracy of the algorithmâ€™s output for all 4 analyzed elections.
